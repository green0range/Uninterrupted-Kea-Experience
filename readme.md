# PyWeek

This project was made for [pyweek](https://www.pyweek.org/) 21. I highly recomend you get involved in the next one. However, that means this is single entry, which I do not plan to contiune. I'm putting it here for future refference, some of the dialogue code may be useful, the rest of it is props too messy.

It is under GPL.

For full details, see readme.odt, or exported pdf.
