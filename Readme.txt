Running the game
The Uninterrupted Kea Experience runs as a python script. Because of this, it requires the follow to be installed:
Python2.7 – download at https://www.python.org/downloads/
Pygame (latest) – download at http://pygame.org/download.shtml
Once these are installed, run the script “main.py” in the root game directory.
In Linux:
	Open your terminal emulator in the game folder.
	Type the following command
	$ python2 main.py
	Note: In some file managers you can right click main.py > open with custom command, set 	the command to 'python2'
In Windows:
	Open the command prompt
	Find where the python executable is stored.
	Type:
	<path/to/python/exe> <path/to/main.py>
